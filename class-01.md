# How the Web Works :incoming_envelope:


> When you visit a website, the web server  <br>
> hosting that site could be anywhere in the <br>
> world. In order for you to find the location of <br>
> the web server, your browser will first connect <br>
> to a Domain Name System (DNS) server. <br>

# ```Before starting the design and going into the coding stage, you have to ask yourself many questions that will collect your business structure and that will facilitate the next steps in your project ..  ``` :bomb:


# Target Audience: individuals
- What is the age range of your target audience?
- Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
- Which country do your visitors live in?
- Do they live in urban or rural areas?
- What is the average income of visitors?
- What level of education do they have?
- What is their marital or family status?
- What is their occupation?
- How many hours do they work per week?
- How often do they use the web?
- What kind of device do they use to access the web?

#####  DOCTYPE,, :mag_right:

> Because there have been several versions of HTML,,
> each web page should begin with a `DOCTYPE` declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using
> (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).
