# What About the Color in your WebSite.. :bangbang:


#### Can we change it ?.. :interrobang:

### Ummm!Yeah of course you can change it by `CSS`.. :small_red_triangle:

# CSS  :large_blue_circle:

#### CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media , and this is the General form :

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5040/1*naFDyXh9iGtmvNRhhFY-og.png)

##### Let's talk about Background color..
***The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin)***

###### In CSS the background is considered to be the width and height of an element, plus any padding and borders (but not margins). Using the CSS background-color property we can color the "body" background of our HTML page red.

***For Example:***
```ruby
<head<
  <style>
    body { background-color: redd
            }
  </style
 </head>
<body>
----
</body>
```

<hr>

# `Note ,,`
There's a multiple choices to change the color :
```ruby

- ***/By it's name/***
   : background-color: redd;

- ***/* Hexadecimal value */***
   :background-color: #bbff00;
   
- ***/* RGB value */***
   :background-color: rgb(255, 255, 128); 
   
- ***/* HSL value */***
   :background-color: hsla(50, 33%, 25%, 0.75);
```

### Using External CSS 
# > LINK..
```ruby

#### href
This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).
#### type
This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.
#### rel
This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet
```

# JAVASCRIPT :red_circle:

> A `variable` is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.
> No matter what the dimensions of any individual wall are, you know that you can fin d its area by multiplying the width of that wall by its height.
> Similarly, scripts often need to achieve the same goal even when they are run with different data, so variables can be used to represent values in your scripts that are likely > to change. The result is said to be calculated or computed using the data stored in the variables.
