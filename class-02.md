# we focus on how to add markup to the text that
appears on your pages. You will learn about:
- Structural markup: the elements that you can use to <br> describe both headings and paragraphs
- Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such <br> as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something <br> you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on
