# HTML Links

> The HTML `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

> `<a href="url">link text</a>`
> The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.




# By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red



# HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link

> To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:


Example
```
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>
```


Link to an Email Address

```
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

```


# Link Titles
> The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

```
<a href="https://www.dana.com/html/" title="Go to HTML section">  Visit our HTML Tutorial  </a>

```
