## Getting Started with _GitHub Pages_


***GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme.***

```Create Your Website```
***Once you’ve signed in, you’ll create a new repository to get started.***

<hr>

#### On the new _repository_ screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website. 
~~The Repo's name cannot be repeated to avoid confusion~~

<hr>

#### Here’s where you’ll write your own content `(You can keep the default content for now, if you’d like)`.

> `Once you’re finished editing, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Commit changes.`

### Making Changes
> One of the first things you can do is remove the default title of your index page, and add a friendlier message to it. Since this is a very quick change _and your first one _ you’re going to make it on the default branch:` main.`

##### View the `_config.yml` file by navigating to it in the **Code** tab. You can edit the file by clicking on the pencil icon.
