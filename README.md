## Getting Started with _GitHub Pages_

***GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme.

''Create Your Website''
***Once you’ve signed in, you’ll create a new repository to get started.

On the new _repository_ screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website.
~~The Repo's name cannot be repeated to avoid confusion~~
